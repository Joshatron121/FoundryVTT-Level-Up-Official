Once between rests you can use a bonus action to roll a d20 and record the result. Before the end of your next short or long rest , when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an ability check , attack roll, or saving throw , you can use your reaction to replace their roll with your recorded result. When the creature is also rolling an expertise die , only the d20 roll is replaced. When the creature is rolling more than one d20, such as when it has advantage or when a halfling is using their Lucky trait, the replacement applies to the creatureâ€™s final roll.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
