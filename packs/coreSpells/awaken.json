Depending on how you treated the target while it was charmed, when the condition ends the awakened creature may choose to remain friendly to you.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Target an additional creature for each slot level above 5th. Each target requires its own material component.</p>",
