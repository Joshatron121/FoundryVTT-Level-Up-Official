		"description": "<p>You conjure a churning storm cloud that spreads to cover the target area. As it forms, lightning and thunder mix with howling winds, and each creature beneath the cloud makes a Constitution saving throw or takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.</p><p>Until the spell ends, at the start of your turn the cloud produces additional effects: Round 2. Acidic rain falls throughout the area dealing 1d6 acid damage to each creature and object beneath the cloud.</p><p>Round 3. Lightning bolts strike up to 6 creatures or objects of your choosing that are beneath the cloud (no more than one bolt per creature or object). A creature struck by this lightning makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.</p><p>Round 4. Hailstones fall throughout the area dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature beneath the cloud.</p><p>Round 5�10. Gusts and freezing rain turn the area beneath the cloud into difficult terrain that is heavily obscured. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible while a creature or its target are beneath the cloud. When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn beneath the cloud or enters into the area, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration. Gusts of strong winds between 20�50 miles per hour automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar effects (whether mundane or magical). Finally, each creature beneath the cloud takes 1d6 cold damage.</p>",
