Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw or takes 4d6 piercing damage. Depending on the material component used, a seed bomb also causes one of the following additional effects: Pinecone. Seed shrapnel explodes outward.</p><p>A creature in the area of the exploding seed bomb makes a Constitution saving throw or it is blinded until the end of its next turn.</p><p>Sunflower. Seeds enlarge into a blanket of pointy needles. The area affected by the exploding seed bomb becomes difficult terrain for the next minute.</p><p>Tumbleweed. The weeds unravel to latch around creatures. A creature in the area of the exploding seed bomb makes a Dexterity saving throw or it becomes grappled until the end of its next turn.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>",
