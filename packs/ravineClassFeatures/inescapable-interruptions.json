On a success, you gain the following effects when you take the Attack action against this creature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain an expertise dice for those attack rolls.</li>\n<li>On a hit, the target's DC for the concentration checks uses your Combat Maneuver DC, or half the damage received, whichever is higher.</li>\n<li>On a hit, the target has disadvantage on checks made to maintain concentration, but has advantage on checks made to resist effects from your Focus Features (such as Stunning Strike).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These effects last either for one minute, until you choose to end it, or until you use this feature on a different target.</p>",
