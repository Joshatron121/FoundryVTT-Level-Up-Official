You don't need to provide the material components for either the contingency spell or the spell cast by contingency.</p>\n<p>After a long rest, you can set the trigger of the contingency (and inform your Narrator). When you do so, you cannot change the trigger until you finish 1d4 long rests.</p>\n<p>The contingency spell protecting you can only cast one of the following spells at 5th level: @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.f0lq2ogke9k8f1v9]{Mislead}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.0cdtrkihoe9jdon1]{Greater Invisibility}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.6y4rq48okutkormg]{Phantasmal Killer} or @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.pdvg7c9emjgnib07]{Confusion}.</p>\n<p>You don't need to know the spell for it to be cast as part of contingency's effect. You can choose which spell is cast when contingency triggers.</p>\n<p>Once contingency has been triggered, this feature cannot be used again before you finish 2d4 long rests.</p>",
