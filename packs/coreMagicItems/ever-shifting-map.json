When this happens, the map shows you the direction to the largest cache of treasure (measured in number of coins and jewels) within 1 mile.</p><p>The map shows you passageways relevant to your destination and gives you advantage on ability checks to find secret doors, but does not note the location of monsters or traps.</p><p>The information on the map disappears after your next long rest, at which point all writing vanishes from the parchment and it becomes a mundane item.</p>",
