The illusion can also be detected by a creature that spends an action inspecting them and succeeds on a DC 13 Investigation check.</p><p>Alternatively, while you are touching these thieves’ tools you can command them to truly become whatever type of artisan’s tools they are disguised as. You add your proficiency bonus to the first ability check you make with that set of artisan’s tools.</p><p>Afterward the artisan’s tools remain in their new form as all magic fades from them and they become a mundane item.</p>",
