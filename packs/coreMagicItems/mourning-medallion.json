    "description": "<p>This medallion hangs from a very old rope made from the braided hair of those long past. When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing it, before going unconscious you can use your reaction to ask the medallion a single question which it answers with “yes,” “no,” or “unknown.” It answers truthfully, using the knowledge of all those who have died. Roll [[/r 1d20]] after using this feature. On a result of 5 or less, the medallion becomes a mundane piece of mourning jewelry. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>Alternatively, you can instead use your reaction to rip the medallion from its braid when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright. You drop to 1 hit point instead and the medallion becomes a mundane piece of mourning jewelry.</p>",
