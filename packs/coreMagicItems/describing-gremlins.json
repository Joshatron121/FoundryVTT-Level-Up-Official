The smallest gremlin explains to the next size up, and so on, with the largest gremlin communicating back to you the description of the contents at a cellular level. </p><p>The gremlins are not particularly intelligent so most of their descriptions are similar to “<em>some sorta green globs</em>”  or “<em>a buncha squidgy spiny things what tried to eat me</em>”.</p><p>Although this information is not scientifically or medically helpful, it can easily be used to identify if a substance is the same as another previously observed substance as the gremlins are consistent in their descriptions.</p>",
