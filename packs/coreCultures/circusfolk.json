While some communities are found in villages and insular neighborhoods, they are most famous for their traveling carnivals. These troupes often began as just a handful of entrepreneuring entertainers but blossomed into big top circuses with caravans complete with support staff, spouses, and new family members. Orphans, runaways, and misfits of all heritages find a new family among circusfolk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The circusfolk oral tradition is exceedingly rich and best known for its trickster characters. These mythological trickster-heroes are numerous and diverse&mdash;some never fail, others undermine their successes through their own folly. They all turn the world upside down. A circusfolk storyteller&rsquo;s excellence is judged not by their perfect recall but by their improvisation and engagement with the audience. All this reveals the unspoken message of circusfolk stories: anything can change.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Characters raised in the circusfolk culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rapid Escape.</em></strong>&nbsp;You can use the Disengage action as a bonus action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Slapstick.</em></strong>&nbsp;You are proficient with improvised weapons, and improvised weapons you use can deal 1d6 damage rather than the damage they normally deal.
