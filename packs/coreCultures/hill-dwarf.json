		"description": "<p>Some dwarves never settle in underground kingdoms. They live in surface communities, trading, learning, and creating. Known as hill dwarves, they are gregarious, friendly, and worldly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No dwarves are more social and artistic than hill dwarves; after all, it&rsquo;s easier to sell your goods if people like you. While they don&rsquo;t consider art to be creation in the same sense as crafting something from a forge, hill dwarves share a deep love for music, poetry, theater, and literature. Many a song or play about the rise and fall of mountain dwarf empires was actually written by troupes of hill dwarves. Their live-and-let-live attitude makes their caravans loud, flashy, and fun.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hill dwarves frequently engage in fist fights to solve minor issues, and would much rather end the day with a black eye than risk making an enemy out of a friend. They don&rsquo;t harbor grudges and don&rsquo;t expect that others do so against them; curiously, other dwarves sometimes have trouble trusting hill dwarves because of their willingness to forgive and forget.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Characters raised in the hill dwarf culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Community Magic.&nbsp;</em></strong>You know the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.uyp8lageqgau1a4h]{friends} cantrip.
