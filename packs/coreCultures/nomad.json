		"description": "<p>There is no one nomadic culture. Most nomadic groups migrate along plains and steppes, following good weather and pasturage for their herd animals. Some groups walk countless miles alongside their cattle or seek peaceful travel, while others train steeds which are the envy of the world, or expect every adult among them to raid the herds of rivals and defend their own. There are nomads that travel within other communities and those that live outside the borders of settled lands but in either case nomads often find themselves in conflict with farmer folk, who desire the same lands that they use. The words &ldquo;barbarians,&rdquo; &ldquo;savages,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hordes&rdquo; are common pejoratives used by townsfolk and cityfolk for their itinerant land rivals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nomadic groups are often close-knit, behaving much like a large family even when they aren&rsquo;t actually related. They&rsquo;re happy to accept strangers in their midst. The only qualifications are an ability to keep up with the group and an understanding of animals because they are among the most skilled animal handlers in the land. Whenever they can be swayed away from their group, they are almost often hired as animal trainers, drivers, or elite cavalry.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Characters raised in this culture share the following traits:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Nature Minded.&nbsp;</em></strong>You are proficient in Animal Handling and Survival, and either Medicine, Nature, or Perception.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>On the Road Again.&nbsp;</em></strong>You are proficient with land vehicles and tinker&rsquo;s tools.
