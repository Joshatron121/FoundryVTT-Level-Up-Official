Lightning or thunder damage from your spells treats immunity to lighting or thunder as though it were lightning or thunder resistance, and ignores lightning or thunder resistance entirely. Additionally, any spell you cast that deals lightning or thunder damage deals additional damage equal to your intelligence modifier on one damage roll.</p>",
