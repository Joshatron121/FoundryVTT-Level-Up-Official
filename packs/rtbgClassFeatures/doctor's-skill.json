The die is a d8. You may expend one of these as an action to heal a target for 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier, and a particular target may only be healed in this way once per short or long rest.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may spend 10 minutes tending to, bandaging, and/or otherwise treating someone and heal them for 1d8 x your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, with no limit to how often you may do so beyond the time required and the number of doctor dice you possess. You may also expend both a doctor die and a hit die as an action to replicate the effects of a *lesser restoration* spell. You regain all expended doctor dice when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>At level 10 your doctor dice increase to 1d10s and you may expend a doctor die and a hit die to replicate a *greater restoration* spell. A creature may only benefit from this greater restoration once per long rest.</p>",
