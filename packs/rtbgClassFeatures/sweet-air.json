You can hold your breath for an additional number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus and have advantage on concentration checks to avoid losing your breath. You also have advantage on saving throws against inhaled poisons and any spell or effect based on inhaling something harmful (such as @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.orjiv7fbrikcns17]{Stinking Cloud}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.764ocg0phxmyw7y2]{Cloudkill}, etc.), and have resistance to any damage they deal.</p>",
