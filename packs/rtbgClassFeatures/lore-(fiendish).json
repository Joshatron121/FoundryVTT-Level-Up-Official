You may later dismiss this familiar back to its home plane as an action by spending another hit die, and you cannot temporarily dismiss it into a pocket dimension. It otherwise follows the normal rules for the find familiar spell.</p>\n<p>If both this and Celestial Lore are taken, it allows you to have two familiars at once, though summoning the second one without dismissing the first inflicts a level of fatigue in addition to the normal costs.</p>",
