This feature must be from a cleric archetype and granted to clerics of 2nd level.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can instead gain Turn Undead with the benefit of two instances of the Destroy Undead empowerment. This latter options gains a third instance of such an empowerment at 14th level, and a 4th at 17th level.</p>\n<p>Once you have used the chosen cleric feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
