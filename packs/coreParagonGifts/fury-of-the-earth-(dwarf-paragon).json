Each creature on the ground in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or is knocked prone. A creature concentrating on a spell makes a Constitution saving throw or its concentration is broken. You can't use this feature again until after you finish a long rest.</p>",
