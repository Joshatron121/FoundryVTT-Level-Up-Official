Are you still?</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:&nbsp;</strong>+1 to Dexterity and one other ability score.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Stealth, and either Deception or Intimidation.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Gaming set, thieves&rsquo; tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 26 gold):&nbsp;</strong>Common clothes, dark cloak, thieves&rsquo; tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Feature: Thieves&rsquo; Cant.</em></strong>&nbsp;You know thieves&rsquo; cant: a set of slang, hand signals, and code terms used by professional criminals. A creature that knows thieves&rsquo; cant can hide a short message within a seemingly innocent statement. A listener who knows thieves&rsquo; cant understands the message.<br>Thieves&rsquo; cant also includes a set of secret written symbols which can convey simple concepts associated with crime such as danger, secret exits, sellers of stolen goods, and whether a location is the territory of a specific gang.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Adventures and Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>If you pull off several successful jobs or heists, you may be promoted (or reinstated) as a leader in your gang.
