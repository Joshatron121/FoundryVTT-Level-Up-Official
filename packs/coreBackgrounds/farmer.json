You&rsquo;ve become an adventurer, a career where the money is plentiful but your days&mdash;if you&rsquo;re not careful&mdash;may be all too short.</p>\n<p>Why did you beat your plowshare into a sword? Do you seek adventure, excitement, or revenge? Do you leave behind a thriving farmstead or a smoking ruin?</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Wisdom and one other ability score.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:&nbsp;</strong>Nature, and either Animal Handling or Survival.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Land vehicles.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 17 gold):&nbsp;</strong>Common clothes, shovel, mule with saddlebags, 5 Supply.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Feature: Bit and Bridle.&nbsp;</em></strong>You know how to stow and transport food.
