Do you seek ancient wisdom? Power? The answer to a specific question? Reinstatement in your former institution?&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Intelligence and one other ability score.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>History, and either Arcana, Culture, Engineering, or Religion.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Languages:</strong>&nbsp;Two of your choice.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 16 gold):&nbsp;</strong>Bottle of ink, pen, 50 sheets of parchment, common clothes.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Feature: Library Privileges</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;As a fellow or friend of several universities you have visiting access to the great libraries, most of which are off-limits to the general public. With enough time spent in a library, you can uncover most of the answers you seek (any question answerable with a DC 20&nbsp;Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Adventures and Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>When you visit libraries and universities you tend to be asked for help in your role as a comparatively rough-and-tumble adventurer. After fetching a few bits of esoteric knowledge and settling a few academic disputes, you may be granted access to the restricted areas of the library (which contain darker secrets and deeper mysteries, such as those answerable with a DC 25&nbsp;Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).</p>",
