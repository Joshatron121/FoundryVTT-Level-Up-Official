The ammunition appears loaded into the weapon. There is no limit to the number of times you can use this ability, but the ammunition cannot be used in conjunction with any spell requiring a ranged weapon attack, your Arcane Ammunition, Expanded Arcane Ammunition, or Supreme Arcane Ammunition features, or with other similar effects. The ammunition lasts for one round and then disappears, whether fired or not.</p>",
