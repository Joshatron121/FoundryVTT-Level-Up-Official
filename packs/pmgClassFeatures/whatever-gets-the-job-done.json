		"description": "<p>At 14th level, you have learned to adapt your tools quickly in an emergency situation. As an action, you can quickly repurpose one of your spell inventions. When you do, select a spell of equal or lower level than the spell inventionâ€™s current spell from the artificer list. The next time the spell invention is used, it casts the selected spell, then automatically fizzles. When you repair the spell invention, you may choose whether it returns to casting whatever spell it was originally built to cast or continues to cast the new spell.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
