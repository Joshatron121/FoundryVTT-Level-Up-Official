Choose one of the following options:</p><h3><strong>Down But Not Out</strong></h3><p>If they are not killed outright, friendly creatures within range of your Commanding Presence ability automatically stabilize when they drop to 0 hit points. This ability only works while you are alive.</p><h3><strong>Unbreakable</strong></h3><p>If you would be reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you instead drop to 1 hit point and may use your reaction to make a single weapon attack against the source of the damage that felled you. If this counterattack is a critical hit, you immediately heal to half of your maximum hit points. Once you have used this ability, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
