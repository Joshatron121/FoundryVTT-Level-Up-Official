As long as you have not died of old age, 24 hours after you die (or in 24 hours, if your death triggered gaining this feature) you miraculously revive intact with full hit points. You appear after &ldquo;narrowly surviving&rdquo; the circumstances that killed you&mdash;climbing out of the chasm you fell down, crawling from the rubble of the structure that collapsed over you, waking up from impossibly lethal wounds that prove superficial, or magically transporting from the plane of existence you were caught in.&nbsp;In addition, the first time you are revived in this way, you gain a +1 bonus on all future attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>",
