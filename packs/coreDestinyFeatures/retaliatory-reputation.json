While you are not incapacitated, you can use a bonus action to direct a threatening stare at any hostile creature within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a Wisdom&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">saving throw</span> with a DC equal to your passive Intimidation score. On a failure, the creature is <span class=\"freelinking-link\">frightened</span>&nbsp;until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to your Retaliatory Reputation for the next 24 hours.</p>",
