While this umbra is active you can move through nonmagical solid objects and occupied spaces as if they were difficult terrain. Opportunity attacks made against you while this umbra is active have disadvantage. You cannot move further than 5 feet into walls or other solid objects in this way. If you would end your turn in an occupied space, you are shunted into the nearest unoccupied space and take [[/r 1d6 #force damage]] force damage.&nbsp;</p>",
