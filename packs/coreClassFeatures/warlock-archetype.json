    "description": "<p>At 1st level, you have reached out to, stumbled upon, or otherwise crossed paths with a powerful entity beyond the ken of mortals, an otherworldly patron who sets you on the path of a Warlock Archetype. Whether you were willing, coerced, tricked— or if you exploited elder magical laws—a bargain was struck and you gained great power in exchange. Your choice of archetype grants you an expanded spell list and features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>",
