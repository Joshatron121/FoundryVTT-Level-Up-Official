Alternatively, you can choose to change a hit with a weapon attack into a critical hit, or when you score a critical hit you can choose to deal maximum damage. All hostile creatures who see your Finishing Blow make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC or become frightened for 1 minute.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
