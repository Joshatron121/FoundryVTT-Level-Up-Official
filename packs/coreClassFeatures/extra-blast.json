When you use Eldritch Ray, Eldritch Scythe, or Eldritch Whip as part of your action on your turn, as long as you make no weapon attacks you can attack twice instead of once. At 11th level you can make three attacks, and at 17th level you can make four attacks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Signika, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span class=\"fontstyle1\">In addition, your Eldritch Disturbance&rsquo;s damage increases by 1d10 at 5th level, and again at 11th level and 17th level (to a maximum of 4d10).</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Signika, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span class=\"fontstyle1\">These improvements are based on your warlock level, not your character level. This feature otherwise counts as Extra Attack (for the purpose of qualifying for feats, spell effects, and the like).</span></p>",
