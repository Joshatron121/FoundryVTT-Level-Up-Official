Choose one of the following:&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>TYRANNIZE</strong></h3><p>You draw upon nature’s power to become a prime example of one of its children. Whenever you assume a wild shape you may choose to assume the apex form of that wild shape. An apex form is one size category larger than the creature’s normal size category (maximum Gargantuan) and any attack made by an apex form wild shape deals an extra 1d8 damage. In addition, while in an apex form wild shape you gain an expertise die on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks and saving throws.</p>",
