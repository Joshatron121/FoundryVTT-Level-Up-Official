Choose one of the following options:</p><h3><strong>Flushing Wrath</strong></h3><p>When you or a friendly creature in the range of your Commanding Presence ability takes the Attack action for the first time against a creature each turn, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. If it fails, it must use its reaction to move at least half its movement speed away from its current position. This movement is considered a use of the Disengage action and as such does not normally provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><h3><strong>Lock Shields</strong></h3><p>You and friendly creatures within the range of your Commanding Presence feature gain a +1 bonus to AC while wielding a shield and within 5 feet of another friendly creature affected by this feature that is also wielding a shield.</p>",
