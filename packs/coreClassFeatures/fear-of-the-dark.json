		"description": "<p>You may spend 2 sorcery points as an action to target a creature you can see within 30 feet. They must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. They may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. If they start their turn <em>blinded</em> or unable to see as a result of darkness, they count as being able to see the source of their fear, and if they start their turn <em>blinded</em> or in darkness they cannot see through they take 2d6 psychic damage. You may only have one creature frightened in this way at a time.</p>",
