If you already have telepathy, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><p>Additionally, when you cast a warlock spell you can choose to do so psionically, without the need for vocalized or seen components. Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
