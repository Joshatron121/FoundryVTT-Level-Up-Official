Beginning at 1st level when you choose this archetype, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. </p><p>In addition, when you arenâ€™t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. How exactly this fortitude manifests on your body can vary widely, but unless actively concealed it marks your connection to dragonkind.</p>",
