With 1 minute’s work you can cobble together a makeshift compass. Compasses made in this way become useless after 1 hour and have no sale value. You’re also adept at surveying your surroundings and you gain an expertise die on checks made for the Chronicle journey activity. <br>In addition, you gain proficiency in Survival and its wayfinding skill specialty. If you already have this skill specialty you instead gain a Survival skill specialty of your choice.</p>",
