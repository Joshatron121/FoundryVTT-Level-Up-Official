		"description": "<p>At 14th level, you are exceptionally good at convincing your foes to attack someone other than yourself. When a creature you can see targets you with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to focus its attention on a creature you choose within its reach or within range of it. It makes a Charisma saving throw and on a failure, it instead targets the chosen creature with its attack or spell (gaining advantage if the chosen creature is an ally). </p><p>Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
