For the duration of your rage, as long as you are holding it the weapon deals an extra [[/r 1d6 #thunder]] thunder damage. <br>The damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level. Only one weapon can be empowered at a time, though you can use a bonus action to transfer the effect to a different weapon.</p><p>In addition, you gain resistance to thunder damage.</p>",
