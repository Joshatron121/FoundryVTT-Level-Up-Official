You gain the following additional Furious Critical ability which does not count against your furious critical options known: </p><h3><strong>Sundering Blow</strong></h3><p>Your attacks destroy the protective measures of your foes. When you score a critical hit, you may choose to either impose the broken property on your targetâ€™s armor or shield (if present) until it is repaired or you reduce the armor class of your target by -2 for one hour if it does not have armor or a shield. A given creature can only be affected by one instance of the -2 armor class reduction at a time.</p><p>In addition, while you are raging, any weapon you wield gains the Breaker property.</p>",
