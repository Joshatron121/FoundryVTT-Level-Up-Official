Even death cannot touch you as you recover from mortal wounds in a flash of holy light, a sudden swelling of unnatural darkness, or another expression of potent divine power. When you die after being reduced to 0 hit points by an attack or spell, after 1d4 rounds you return to life with 100 hit points. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
