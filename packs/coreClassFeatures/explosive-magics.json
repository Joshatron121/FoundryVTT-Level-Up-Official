When you cast a spell of 4th-level or lower that deals damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to half the spellâ€™s level (minimum 1) to reroll any dice that have the maximum result and add them to the total. For example, if you cast an exploding&nbsp;fireball&nbsp;and roll three 6s among your damage dice, you roll an additional 3d6, and continue to reroll any 6s adding them to the total damage dealt.</p>",
