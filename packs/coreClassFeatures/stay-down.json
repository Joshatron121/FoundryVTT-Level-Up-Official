A creature attempting to wake such an unconscious creature must either deal damage to it equal to twice your proficiency bonus or must make a Medicine check against your maneuver DC to do so. Creatures wake naturally at the end of durations normally.</p><p>Creatures that you reduce to zero hit points also have disadvantage on their death saves.</p>",
