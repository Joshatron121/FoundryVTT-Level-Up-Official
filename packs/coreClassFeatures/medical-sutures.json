You can create the following additional items using Tactical Chemistry:</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.989ahbuhi1cqvrmy]{Bandage}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.067o6hjosd8nrjs8]{Healer's Satchel} (1 use)</p></li></ul><p>In addition, you can reattach a severed limb or body part. The limb or body part must be relatively intact and the injury must be no more than 8 hours old. The reattaching process takes 1 hour and requires a DC 14 leatherworker’s tools or sewing kit check. On a success the limb or body part is attached and functional with no further complications. On a failure the limb cannot be saved.</p><p>Alternatively, you can replace a lost limb or body part with a donor part. This donor part must be analogous to a missing part (an arm for an arm, a leg for a leg), and it must be from a humanoid creature of the same size. The reattaching process requires a DC 20 leatherworker’s tools or sewing kit check when performed in this way.</p>",
