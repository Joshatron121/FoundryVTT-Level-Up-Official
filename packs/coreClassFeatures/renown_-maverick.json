You add half your proficiency bonus to your Prestige rating.</p><p>In addition, your reputation strongly affects how you are perceived, and when it becomes known that you are in a settlement people treat you accordingly. At the Narrator’s discretion, there may be settlements (such as an enemy’s war camp) where you cannot utilize this feature. </p><h4><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maverick</strong></h4><p>When you arrive in a settlement, after you reveal who you are the local watch starts keeping an eye on you. Heads of illegal organizations may introduce themselves to you if they have goals well suited to your talents.</p><p>Additionally, guards expect you’re up to no good so are quick to leave their posts to follow you.</p>",
