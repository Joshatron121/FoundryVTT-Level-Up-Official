You always have this spell prepared, it doesnâ€™t count toward your maximum prepared spells, and you can cast this spell at its lowest level without expending a spell slot. </p><p>Once you have cast a Signature Spell in this way, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again. </p><p>At higher levels, you gain additional Signature Spells, each of which you can cast once between rests. At 11th level, you can choose one 2nd-level Signature Spell. At 17th level, you can choose one 3rd-level Signature Spell. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of your Signature Spells with another of the same level.</p>",
