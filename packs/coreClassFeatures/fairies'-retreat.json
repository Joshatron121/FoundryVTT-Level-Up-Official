		"description": "<p>At 14th level, you can instantly traverse the Dreaming to a place of hopeful refuge. You can use an action to teleport yourself and up to five willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, disappearing in flashes of bright color or a vortex of leaves. You each reappear no further than 1 mile away, in the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of your Toadstool Sanctuary, or a fairy ring or monolith consecrated to the fey which you have previously seen. If you are already at such a location when you use this feature, you and the creatures instead teleport into or return from the Dreaming.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
