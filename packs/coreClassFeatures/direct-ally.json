If that ally hits that target with an attack before the start of your next turn, their attack deals an extra 1d8 damage. </p><p>The bonus dice increase to 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level. After you use this trick, you can choose the same ally again, but cannot choose the same target for the rest of the encounter.</p>",
