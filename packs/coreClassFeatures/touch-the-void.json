Each of these spells is slightly different when cast using this feature, as described below:</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Astral Projection.</em></strong> The spell requires no material components, but only affects you.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dream.</em></strong> You are the messenger in the dream, and while you are influencing the dream you are completely detached from your body.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Etherealness</em></strong><em>.</em> When the spell ends, you reappear in the space you were in when you originally cast the spell.</p><p>After using this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
