Your access to this energy is represented by your exertion pool. You can spend exertion points to fuel various focus features.</p><p>You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Long Step, and Patient Defense. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.</p><p>Some of your focus features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Focus save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"></p><h4><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Flurry of Blows</strong></h4><h4><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Long Step</strong></h4><h4><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Patient Defense</strong></h4>",
