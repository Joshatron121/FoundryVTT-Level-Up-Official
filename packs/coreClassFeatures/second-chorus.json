When you see a spell cast on an ally within 30 feet, you can use your reaction and expend a use of Bardic Inspiration  to twin it. If the spell is of 3rd-level or lower, targets only that ally, and you are also within the spellâ€™s range, you are also targeted by the spell. </p><p>When you reach 14th level in this class, you can expend two uses of Bardic Inspiration to twin a spell to target a different ally instead of you</p>",
