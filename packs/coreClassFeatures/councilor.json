You may spend inspiration to allow yourself or another creature to regain a use of an ability with limited uses per long rest. This cannot be used to restore spell slots, nor can a single creature benefit from this more than once per long rest. You also gain inspiration anytime you finish a long rest if you do not already have it.</p>",
