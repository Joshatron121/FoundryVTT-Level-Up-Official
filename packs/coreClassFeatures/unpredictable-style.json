		"description": "<p>Starting at 11th level, the unpredictability of your combat style bleeds over to all aspects of your life. You can approach problems from unforeseen angles, using somewhat brutal solutions that get the job done swifty (if messily). When you make any ability check that could use a skill or tool you are not proficient with, you can roll your martial arts die and add it to that check. On a success, you canâ€™t use this feature with the same ability until you finish a short or long rest. On a failure, you fall prone and roll your martial arts die, taking damage equal to that amount.</p><p>[[/r 1d4 #d4 die]]   [[/r 1d6 #d6 die]]   [[/r 1d8 #d8 die]]   [[/r 1d10 #d10 die]]   [[/r 1d12 #d12 die]]</p>",
