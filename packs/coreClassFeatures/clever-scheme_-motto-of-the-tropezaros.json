Once per short rest you can produce a non-magical item that you could have purchased or prepared at some point, small enough to fit in whatever storage you have available. This could range from a forged passport in your pocket to a glider stowed in the hold of a ship you’re traveling on. Pay the appropriate price for it. Limits of causality apply.</p>",
