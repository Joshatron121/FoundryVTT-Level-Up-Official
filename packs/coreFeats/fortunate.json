Whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw and do not have disadvantage, you may spend a fate point to roll an additional d20 and choose whichever result you wish. You may do this after the initial roll has occurred, but before the outcome is known. If you have disadvantage, you may instead spend a fate point to choose one of the d20 rolls and reroll it.</p><p>Alternatively, when you are attacked, you may choose to spend a fate point to force the attacking creature to reroll the attack. The creature resolves the attack with the result you choose.</p><p>You regain all expended fate points when you finish a long rest.</p>",
