You can cast bard spells during that rage, but the total number of spell levels you can cast over the course of that particular rage cannot exceed maximum value of your bardic inspiration die (6 for a d6, 8 for a d8, etc.) You still cannot concentrate on spells, nor may you cast non-bard spells.</p>",
