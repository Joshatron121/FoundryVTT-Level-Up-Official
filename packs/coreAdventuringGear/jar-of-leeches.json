You can expend one use of this jar during a short rest to administer leeches to yourself or a willing creature. A creature who has leeches administered to them cannot regain hit points during this short rest due to blood loss, but it may repeat a saving throw to remove the poisoned condition or a blood-borne disease (DC equal to the original effect).</p><p>Alternatively, as an action you can throw this jar up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the jar as an improvised weapon. On a hit, if the target is a Large or smaller creature it takes 1d4 ongoing damage. A creature can end this damage by using its action to remove the leeches.</p>",
