		"description": "<p>Playing dead, you surprise your foe with a sudden attack.</p><p>When you lose hit points, you can use your reaction to fall prone and pretend to be dead. All hostile creatures able to see you consider you to be dead or dying.</p><p>If a creature moves within your reach before the beginning of your next turn, you can immediately stand up and spend exertion to use a Tooth and Claw maneuver you know against it. No action is required to activate the maneuver and any melee attacks made as part of the maneuver have advantage.</p><p>After you have used Wounded Animal Gambit against a creature, if you activate it again before the end of combat it receives a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it realizes you are playing dead.</p>",
