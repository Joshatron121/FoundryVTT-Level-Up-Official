Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you may choose the type of damage that spell deals and the appearance of the spell&rsquo;s effects. For example, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.c9itysok7lr2ai51]{Scorching Rays} made to deal cold damage might look like icicle spears, a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.n7vv8e7phkfc513j]{Fireball} that deals radiant damage may appear to be an explosive host of warrior angels, and a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.idachh0qpbbyne7c]{Lightning Bolt} that deals psychic damage may be a strange color or accompanied by unnatural howls.</p>",
