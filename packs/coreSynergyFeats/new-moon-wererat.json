While you are transformed, you gain the following features.</p><p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> You gain a bite natural weapon you are proficient with. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your bite. On a hit your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier (whichever is highest).</p><p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You canâ€™t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><p><strong><em>Keen Smell.</em></strong> You have advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.</p>",
