You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Treat your prestige rating as a point higher than it is (minimum 5) when dealing with soldiers, mercenaries, bodyguards, assassins, and others for whom violence and force of arms are a way of life.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you would acquire the stunned condition, you can spend a point of exertion to be rattled instead. If you would acquire the paralyzed condition, you can spend a point of exertion to be slowed instead. In either case, the duration is the same as the initial condition, or one minute if the initial condition would be permanent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You treat all melee weapons you are proficient with that lack the heavy and/or two-handed properties as adept weapons. You gain the following feature:<br><br><strong>Menacing Kata: </strong>While wielding an adept weapon, you can spend an action to perform a display of supreme weapon prowess. Enemies within 30 feet who can see you must make a Wisdom save against your maneuver DC or be rattled for one minute. Creatures that fail their save by more than 5 are frightened instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
